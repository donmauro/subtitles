1
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:28,167
L'amore a vent'anni
2
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,126
<i>Mattino, mi sveglio cantando</i>

3
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:59,667
<i>La sera, a letto ballando</i>

4
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:10,292
<i>Non mi preoccupo</i>

5
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,834
<i>Delle bombe in volo</i>

6
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,959
<i>Quel giorno ci uccideranno tutti</i>

7
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,876
<i>Non serve preoccuparsi!</i>

8
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:17,209
<i>Antoine Doinel oggi ha 20 anni.</i>

9
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,376
<i>I suoi scherzi dispettosi
lo hanno portato davanti al giudice.
</i>

10
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:24,042
<i>Dopo aver abbandonato la sua casa, si sente libero.</i>

11
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:27,542
<i>Antoine ha organizzato, con cura, una sua vita indipendente.</i>

12
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,792
<i>Amante della musica,
lavora in una casa discografica.</i>

13
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,917
<i>Finalmente ha realizzato il suo sogno,</i>

14
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,876
<i>vivendo da solo con una paga,</i>

15
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,334
<i>camminando con i suoi piedi...</i>

16
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:52,626
<i>Icsritto in un music club per giovani
non perde mai un evento.</i>

17
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:57,251
<i>Riesce ad ottenere biglietti gratuiti per importanti concerti.</i>

18
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:59,626
<i>IL suo unico amico è René Biget,</i>

19
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:01,709
<i>un agente di borsa.</i>

20
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:03,084
Come va il mercato azionario?

21
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,084
Bene. Presto diventerò un agente di cambio.

22
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,792
Sto andando in fabbrica.

23
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,626
Ho due biglietti per stasera, per Shapiro.

24
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:15,417
Ricordi quando ti nascondevi nella mia stanza e mio papà è entrato?
Quanto fumo!

25
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,417
Mio padre!

26
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:21,501
Aiutami a scuotere le coperte per togliere  il fumo!

27
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,667
Va bene, basta!

28
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:35,292
Ma cos'è? Un affumicatoio!

29
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,376
Sembra una bisca!

30
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:40,751
Bene, ti tratterrò tre sigari dalla tua paghetta.
31
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:44,876
Bucefalo non è un attaccapanni!

32
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:50,459
Ne vale migliaia!
È un'opera d'arte!

33
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:54,001
Non lo venderei mai. 

34
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:58,542
Adesso state buoni e andate a letto!

35
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,084
Buona notte!

36
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,667
Mi aveva quasi scoperto!

37
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,251
Vide i tuoi piedi ma non disse nulla.

38
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:15,167
E ora di andare.

39
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:29,667
Non l'avevo mai notata. Mi piace veramente.

40
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:32,792
Molto! Come la sua amica?

41
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,626
Sarebbe perfetto!

42
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:38,876
Ho una storia con mia cugina.
Porta i capelli lunghi.

43
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:43,084
Vuole tagliarli. Grande!

44
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,584
L'ami?

45
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,834
Non saprei. Non ho detto nulla.
Se la preferisco con i capelli corti,

46
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,209
- Glielo scriverò.
- Dimmi come va...

47
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:52,584
8 GIORNI DOPO

48
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:57,959
L'ho vista tre volte la settimana scorsa.
Non le ho ancora parlato, ma si è accorta di me.

49
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:01,084
Giovedi' scorso all'<i>Eroica,</i>

50
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,001
<i>Ero seduto dietro di lei.</i>

51
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:08,084
<i>Ha slacciato la sciarpa.
Le ho osservato il collo ed i capelli.</i>

52
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,417
<i>L'ho fissata per tutta la serata!</i>

53
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:13,917
<i>Ho deciso di parlarle e l'ho rincorsa ,</i>

54
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,959
<i>ma ha incontrato un'amica.</i>

55
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,542
<i>Sono tornato a casa... a dormire.</i>

56
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:23,501
<i>Giovedì, sono arrivato presto per sedermi accanto a lei.</i>

57
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:27,084
<i>Non c'era ancora nessuno,
cos' ho fumato una sigaretta</i>

58
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,709
<i>finchè la sala si è riempita.</i>

59
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:33,626
<i>Quando sono entrato, in un primo momento non l'ho vista.</i>

60
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,667
<i>Ma stava parlava con una amica.</i>

61
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:40,751
<i>Mi sono seduto accanto a lei.
Lei annuì come se mi conoscesse.</i>

62
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,376
<i>Ma lei andò a sedersi
dove aveva lasciato il suo cappotto!</i>

63
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:48,292
<i>Non ho osato cambiare posto.</i>

64
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,459
<i>The third time was yesterday.</i>

65
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:55,834
<i>She was carrying home her groceries,</i>

66
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,709
in my neighbourhood!

67
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:00,626
The preliminaries are over. Attack!

68
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:17,667
What has Pierre Schaeffer taught us? A lot.

69
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:22,459
He's dealt musicology a staggering blow.

70
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,376
Clichy's my stop.
Odd I didn't see you sooner.

71
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:28,917
You go often?

72
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:33,626
Yes, to all the Russian concerts.
Sunday mornings.

73
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,626
Not much fun!

74
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,584
It's a shame,
but we'd have met sooner or later.

75
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,251
Don't I live near you?
I saw you with your shopping.

76
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:46,626
I live on Lécluse.

77
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,084
What do you do?

78
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:54,792
I'm a student. And you?

79
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,001
- I'm in records.
- You work?

80
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,084
For Philips.

81
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,459
I'm on my own.

82
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:04,376
It must be strange to be independent!

83
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,334
That depends, because...

84
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,751
It's my stepfather's car!

85
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:17,084
Going to the Gavoty lecture?

86
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,751
Probably.

87
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:24,292
If not, I'll surely be at the concert
the next night or the night after.

88
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:28,751
Okay, but what's your phone number?
I'll see you again, right?

89
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:32,792
Yes, but call in the evening.
I'm not always in.

90
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,334
It's Carnot 08-32.

91
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,167
Well, I've got work!

92
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,792
Goodnight. See you!

93
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,876
<i>Antoine and Colette met often
and traded books and records.</i>

94
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:50,167
<i>Over lemonades, they discussed stereo,</i>

95
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,834
<i>and walked home
and talked for hours in doorways.</i>

96
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:04,292
<i>To her, he was a pal.
He didn't notice it, or else it pleased him.</i>

97
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:12,792
Friends, this is the second discussion
of experimental music.

98
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,917
After the first one with Pierre Schaeffer,

99
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:19,584
I knew by your attentiveness

100
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:23,126
and from your numerous letters

101
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,917
how interested you were!

102
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,584
- Colette?
<i>- Yes, it's me.</i>

103
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,376
<i>- My head aches!</i>
- Where were you last night? Sick?

104
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,459
<i>I only said "maybe"!
I went to a party with friends.</i>

105
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:01,459
<i>Really crazy people. We had a ball!</i>

106
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:06,501
<i>It was terrific but really crazy at the end.</i>

107
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:10,209
<i>I got home at 5:00 this morning!</i>

108
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,459
Can I see you this afternoon?

109
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:17,751
<i>I might be out. We all said
we'd meet again this afternoon.</i>

110
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,084
Okay, see you later!

111
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,251
<i>Come by if you want.</i>

112
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:43,542
Is Colette in?

113
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:46,959
- No, why?
- I brought her books back.

114
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:50,417
- I'll take them.
- And this letter, too.

115
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,709
I'll give her everything.

116
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,709
- You're Antoine?
- Yes.

117
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,584
She's mentioned you often. Come in!

118
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,501
- Who is it?
- A friend of Colette's!

119
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,959
- Got a moment?
- I don't want to bother.

120
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,959
It's Antoine!

121
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,084
You're in her class?

122
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:16,501
They met at the youth concerts.
Colette told us!

123
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,251
Antoine works! In records, right?

124
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,084
Yes, for Philips.

125
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,167
Fine!

126
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:28,001
I think young folks
should go to work early in life.

127
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,959
I started at 15 at Labord's Garage.

128
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:32,834
Now I'm the boss!

129
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,667
I never drink.

130
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,501
Education's no help.
Take Victor Hugo!

131
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:42,709
Please! Never mind Victor Hugo!

132
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:48,626
He denounced evil, but didn't cure it.

133
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,292
Right?

134
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,167
Perhaps!

135
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,417
Well, I must go. Excuse me.

136
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,959
Going already? Colette will be sorry.

137
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:05,042
- Me, too!
- You must come to dinner soon!

138
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,459
I'll talk to Colette.

139
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:21,959
<i>Your love letter was well-written,</i>

140
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,834
<i>it shows you're experienced!</i>

141
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:27,251
<i>Will you be at Leroux's tonight?</i>

142
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,501
<i>Thanks for the books.</i>

143
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:33,709
<i>Mother says you're romantic
because of your hair.</i>

144
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,251
<i>See you tonight. Colette.</i>

145
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,584
- Look who I see!
- Antoine!

146
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,084
Just opposite us!

147
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,751
What's going on?

148
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:53,001
- You live there now?
- Yes.

149
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,959
- Since when?
- This afternoon.

150
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:01,917
Can we come up?

151
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:17,417
He's all settled in!

152
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:29,459
A washbasin! A telephone!

153
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,667
Come look out the window!

154
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:36,167
You can see our two windows!

155
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:38,501
But we get the sun.

156
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:41,751
Are your folks alive?

157
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:45,959
Yes, but I don't see them often. We fight.

158
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,292
That's a shame!

159
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:50,751
Your mama must miss you!

160
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,167
It's my fault.

161
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:55,876
At home, I ran away often.

162
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:58,376
- If only Colette would!
- Don't try me!

163
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:01,542
A family is...

164
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:06,459
Where is one better off
than with one's family? Anywhere!

165
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:10,334
- Hervé Bazin!
- Yes, in <i>Viper in the Fist!</i>

166
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:14,209
Colette may not look like it, but...

167
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:18,126
- François, pour!
- Incredible!

168
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,459
No respect any more!

169
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,709
<i>Colette's parents liked young people</i>

170
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:47,667
<i>and soon adopted Antoine
and invited him often.</i>

171
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,667
<i>Antoine watched Colette come and go.</i>

172
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:54,251
<i>She treated him as before.</i>

173
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:58,876
<i>His move didn't deepen their friendship.</i>

174
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:08,376
How are you?
What brings you by?

175
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:11,917
I got two seats for Gavoty
on electronic music.

176
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:15,542
No, I have a lot of work this afternoon.

177
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,167
How about a film?

178
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:21,626
I can't. I have an essay
that's due tomorrow.

179
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:26,709
- Can't we talk a while?
- No. Some other time. Bye!

180
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:35,709
What a schmuck!
I'm off to a bad start.

181
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:40,542
I shouldn't be in love with her.
She talks to me like a pal.

182
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:44,084
When I get serious, she laughs!

183
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:47,876
I wait hours for her till I'm frozen!

184
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:50,792
Well, I'll tell you about my cousin.

185
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:55,834
She cut her hair like Joan of Arc.
I love her and write to her.

186
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,834
Here's one from her!

187
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:01,917
Terrific!

188
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:04,167
And the envelope!

189
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:04,792
I'm in record manufacture now.

190
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:07,417
- Ice cream?
- No, thanks.

191
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:10,709
It's the first record I made. It's for you!

192
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:13,876
- That's nice!
- It took a long time!

193
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:22,709
Ice cream, chocolate, sweets
and caramels.

194
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:49,667
<i>The French and Austrians
fought at the Auberon Slalom.</i>

195
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:54,834
<i>Charles Bozon finished
both heats and took second place</i>

196
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:56,626
<i>in front of Burger.</i>

197
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,834
<i>Adrien Duvillard finished fourth,</i>

198
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:02,209
<i>in front of Leitner
and his Austrian namesake.</i>

199
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,001
<i>The Swiss, Mathis,</i>

200
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,501
<i>who was winning in the first heat,</i>

201
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,834
<i>won the slalom
in two minutes, four seconds.</i>

202
00:25:15,876 --> 00:25:19,834
<i>Once again, the Austrian
Zimmermann won the heat</i>

203
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:23,126
<i>and took second place,
which Schranz then stole...</i>

204
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,834
I knocked for five minutes!
Are you deaf?

205
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:50,001
It's dark in here! Are you sick?

206
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:54,292
I wanna set things straight.

207
00:25:56,042 --> 00:26:00,876
All these little games...
I can't stand it!

208
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:03,459
You're an idiot!

209
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:09,167
Sure, it's my fault.
I shouldn't have moved here.

210
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:13,751
I'm gonna move back where I was.

211
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:17,209
So don't lead me on!

212
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:21,126
- Leave me alone!
- What a bore!

213
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:24,167
But you're invited to dinner!

214
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,501
I won't go!

215
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,667
Never mind that. Come to dinner.

216
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:37,042
If you change your mind,
we'll eat in 15 minutes.

217
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,251
- Had dinner?
- Yes.

218
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,209
- Sure?
- Yes, thanks.

219
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:14,334
Really? I can make an omelette quickly!

220
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:17,501
I'll have a tangerine.

221
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,501
What's new?

222
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:22,084
Going out tonight?

223
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:25,792
I got two seats for Schwarzhof.
But I don't know.

224
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,376
- Go on!
- I can't!

225
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:28,459
Why?

226
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:30,709
Never you mind!

227
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:36,459
The Schwarzhof recital's on TV.

228
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,417
Want a plate?

229
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:41,792
No, don't bother.

230
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:46,917
Who is it?

231
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,334
It's a real procession.

232
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:09,126
This is Albert. I told you about him.

233
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,917
- You know Antoine.
- We met once.

234
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:19,751
I'll get my coat!

235
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:22,542
A cigarette, please.

236
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:30,501
I'm ready. We're off! So long!

237
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,417
Have a nice evening!

238
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:42,917
Let's watch that TV programme.

239
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:45,001
Could I have a light?

240
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:06,459
<i>He has kindly made an exception for us.</i>

241
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,167
<i>He has admitted that...</i>

242
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:26,126
<i>They fall in love</i>

243
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:28,959
<i>all over the world!</i>

244
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:32,292
<i>All the youth of the world</i>

245
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:35,751
<i>bite into life</i>

246
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:40,709
<i>as if it were a big apple!</i>

247
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,792
<i>The first kiss!</i>

248
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,376
<i>Hello, sorrow!</i>

249
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:51,917
<i>Take my heart!
Give me your hand!</i>

250
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:58,376
<i>It goes wrong! It goes right!</i>

251
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:02,834
<i>Youth is so fleeting,</i>

252
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:08,126
<i>when two by two they go their way,</i>

253
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:13,001
<i>singing down the highway,
when you're 20 and in love!</i>
